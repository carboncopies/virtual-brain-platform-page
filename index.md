## Welcome to the Virtual Brain Platform page

This is the webpage for the Virtual Brain Platform research project developed by the Carboncopies Foundation. The VBP consists of a software framework that is being designed to facilitate the development of new neuromimetic prostheses.

### About the Carboncopies Foundation

The [Carboncopies Foundation](https://carboncopies.org/) is a 501(c)(3) research non-profit foundation headquartered in San Francisco, CA, with the vision of providing support to scientists in fields related to Whole Brain Emulation (WBE).  Core assumptions of the Carboncopies Foundation are that the detailed functions of the human brain can be mathematically described like those of any physical system or device, that those representations can be implemented in prosthetic devices with equivalent or improved function, resulting in so-called whole brain emulation, and that such a procedure enables unlimited secure backup, reliable restoration, and beneficial upgrading for individuals and as an option for self-directed evolution of humanity as a whole.

Whole brain emulation requires accurate computational modeling of neural circuits found in a patientâ€™s brain tissue at the scale of complete brain regions and the entire brain, as well as the development of neuromorphic hardware that can efficiently run the resulting emulation, effectively constituting a prosthetic brain for the patient. Many advances are needed in neurobiology, brain imaging, computational hardware, nanotechnology, and the cognitive sciences in order to reproduce the functions of a mind in an artificial substrate.
